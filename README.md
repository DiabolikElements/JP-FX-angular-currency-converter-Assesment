## About

This is the assesment for pakati.

I used the following FX API as it had some extra added features I could use and was also open source, as the assigment mentioned there is a different API for PROD.
API - [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/free).



## Features

- allows us to covert our currency to anyone we choose
- Saves the selected currencies with the entered amount and enters the value in localStorage
- Adapts to the size of the browser windows
